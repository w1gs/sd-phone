-- Phones, numbers and who owns what. Pick your setup:
--
--   Stock phone (shared data, automatic numbers)        -> Enabled = false   (DEFAULT)
--   Unique phones, SIM cards carry the number           -> Enabled = true, DataOwner = 'device'
--   Unique phones, no SIM items (built-in numbers)      -> Enabled = true, DataOwner = 'device', BuiltInNumbers = true
--   Stock data, SIMs only change your number            -> Enabled = true, DataOwner = 'character'
--   The SIM IS the phone (original unique phones)       -> Enabled = true, DataOwner = 'sim'
--
-- When enabled, numbers come from sim_card items - or, with BuiltInNumbers, from the phone
-- itself (no SIM items at all). Who owns the DATA is DataOwner:
--
--   * DataOwner = 'device' (DEFAULT) - the PHONE owns the data, the SIM only lends a number.
--     Each phone item carries a persistent identity minted on first use, and that identity keys
--     everything (messages, contacts, photos, notes, settings, installed apps, games). Popping
--     a SIM out just drops your number/service: the phone still opens and every non-number app
--     keeps working. Moving a SIM to another phone hands that phone your NUMBER, not your data.
--
--   * DataOwner = 'sim' (LEGACY) - the SIM owns the data. Whichever SIM sits in a phone
--     decides WHOSE phone data you see; steal a phone with its SIM and you read the owner's
--     phone. Without a SIM the phone opens to a "No SIM" screen with no service and every
--     server action refused. This is the original unique-phones behaviour, byte-for-byte.
--
--   * DataOwner = 'character' - the STOCK data model with SIM numbers on top. Every phone
--     opens the holder's own character profile (a stolen phone shows the thief's data, never
--     the owner's), and without a SIM the character keeps a vanilla auto-assigned number with
--     full service. Installing a SIM changes ONLY the number; ejecting falls back to a fresh
--     auto number. Enabling this on an existing stock server keeps everyone's data untouched.
--
-- With 'device'/'sim' the number follows the SIM, and the Cloud Backup section in Settings
-- lets a player carry their data to a new phone (the number stays behind on the old SIM).
--
-- Backend support: reading/writing per-slot item metadata is required. Supported out of the box:
--   * ox_inventory              (metadata mode, or the physical SIM-tray mode below)
--   * qb-inventory / ps / lj    (metadata mode via the QBCore item `info` table)
-- Other inventories (qs / tgiann / codem / origen / jaksam) need a small adapter in
-- server/sim/inv.lua; plain ESX inventory has no item metadata and cannot support this feature.
return {

    -- character, phone always has service).
    Enabled = false,

    -- Where the phone DATA lives: 'device' | 'sim' | 'character' (see the header above).
    -- Flipping an existing 'sim' server to 'device' is safe: on first use each phone ADOPTS the
    -- identity of the SIM currently in it (grandfathering, no data copied or lost), and only
    -- from then on does the number float free of the data. (The pre-DataOwner boolean
    -- `DeviceIdentity` is still honoured when this key is absent.)
    DataOwner = 'sim',

    -- Unique phones WITHOUT SIM cards ("eSIM"): every phone mints its own permanent number the

    -- with the phone. Pairs with DataOwner 'device' or 'character' ('sim' has no SIM identity
    -- to own data and coerces to 'device'); forces the metadata attach mode. SimItem, SimTray,

    SimItem = 'sim_card',

    -- Using a blank sim_card (no number metadata - what shops, loot tables and admin spawns

    -- the phone item in ox_inventory/data/items.lua (see README - "Unique Phones & SIM Cards"):

    -- contacts, photos, notes, settings, app logins, ...) onto the new SIM's profile. The old
