-- bridge bootstrap that detects the running framework.

}

-- Only the *entry points* are listed below. Every other module is loaded
-- via ox_lib's `require` from one of these files (or transitively from
-- another required module). Duplicating an already-required file in
-- client_scripts / server_scripts would re-execute its top-level side
-- effects (CreateThread, RegisterNetEvent, ...), so we deliberately keep
-- this list lean.

    'bridge/client/init.lua',

    -- oxmysql wrapper is loaded first so any module pulled in below can
    -- reach `MySQL.*` at top-level require time without ordering tricks.

-- files{} is the CLIENT download manifest: everything here is fetchable by any
-- connected client. Server modules are loaded from disk by ox_lib `require` off
-- the server_scripts entry points, so they never belong here - listing
-- server/**.lua would ship the whole authoritative validation layer (and any
-- secret placed in server code) to every client for no benefit. Only the
-- config + bridge + client sources the NUI/client side actually `require` are
-- exposed.

    -- The live game-view renderer for the Camera app (patched three.js +
    -- CfxTexture, vendored under web/src/render/three) is part of the Vite
    -- bundle: it ships as a lazy-loaded chunk in web/build/assets/*.js.

    -- Maps tiles are deliberately NOT bundled: both styles stream from the
    -- free Cloudflare Pages CDN (https://sd-maptiles.pages.dev - see
    -- TILE_SOURCES in web maps/data.ts). Bundling tile pyramids makes FXServer
    -- hash tens of thousands of files at resource start, which blows
    -- txAdmin's 90s start limit and kills the server. See web HIGH_RES_TILES.md.

-- sd-phone answers exports['lb-phone']:* calls and satisfies `dependency 'lb-phone'`

-- this server is escrow-encrypted with no key, so it can never actually start; if it
-- ever does, the runtime guard skips the compat layer and warns instead of racing it.
